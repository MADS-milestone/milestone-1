We will take a closer look at the following definitions/assumptions before getting into questions-\r\n","\r\n","1.   Stakeholders - We will consider the Commuters travelling in the Taxis and Taxi owners/drivers as stakeholders\r\n","2.   Decisions - Depending on the stakeholders we chose, there can be different decisions - for example, Taxi drivers can prefer fewer trips in a winter season compared to a summer season while commuters would prefer a taxi ride more often in a winter season compared to a summer season\r\n","3. Time period/ other assumptions  - We will be utilizing the taxi rides information between 2017 to 2019 to highlight the trends. There can be few interactive effects with the entry of Uber/Lyft. Due to data reliability issues, we will not be able to attribute this interactive effect\r\n","\r\n","Now that we have a clearer understanding of the problem space, there are two main areas that we would like to address through this project depending on the stakeholder -\r\n","\r\n","1. If you are a traveler or commuter - You can plan your trip by answering:\r\n","    a. How does the average fare/trip vary across the various taxi zones of New York with changing timeline and weather conditions?\r\n","    b. What is the average time/trip between two points in New York? How does that change with the weather variations across the time?\r\n","    c. At a given point in time and at a given temperature range, how does the availability of the taxis vary? (Please note: Availability is defined as number of active rides at a given point in time)\r\n","2. If you want to help a taxi driver/owner - You can help them plan their next season by answering : \r\n","    a. How do the taxi availability vary across the various taxi zones? How do the weather conditions relate with the taxi availability over time? \r\n","    b. What can be a reasonable fare estimate / trip that the owner can quote between the origin and destination?\r\n","\r\n","While we enlisted the areas/ questions that we would like to provide insights to the stakeholders, we will further broaden/alter the scope of analysis as we go through the data mining exercise. As an outcome of this exercise, we would like to create a framework for the commuters and taxi driver/owners that helps them to plan their trips across various time points, locations and weather conditions"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ozyQr9b4ENY9"},"source":["# Datasets and Data Sources"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"TZmkynppIPog"},"source":["## <b>Data Source 1</b> : ##\r\n","\r\n","> NYC Open Data -  New York Yellow & Green Taxi Trip data (Timestamp level)\r\n","  1.
